# LBP-HISTOGRAM

Local binary patterns (LBP) is a type of visual descriptor used for classification in computer vision.
The purpose of this code is to create a histogram of gray level for any picture and you can else click where ever you want into the picture and she will  show you 16x16 box of  where you clicked alongside with its histogram, showing also the image after the LBP algorithm is applied.
